# Data Distribution Service for NASA RETHi Project

This repository contains the source code of Data Repository System of NASA-RETHi project. The whole RETHi project aims to develop the Resilient Extra-Terrestrial Habitats for future Moon/Mars expedition, which is divided into three related research thrusts:

1. **System Resilience** develop the techniques needed to establish a control-theoretic paradigm for resilience, and the computational capabilities needed to capture complex behaviors and perform trade studies to weigh different choices regarding habitat architecture and onboard decisions.
2. **Situational Awareness** develop and validate generic, robust, and scalable methods for detection and diagnosis of anticipated and unanticipated faults that incorporates an automated active learning framework with robots- and humans-in-the-loop.
3. **Robotic Maintenance** develop and demonstrate the technologies needed to realize teams of independent autonomous robots, incorporating the use of soft materials, that navigate through dynamic environments, use a variety of modular sensors and end-effectors for specific needs, and perform tasks such as collaboratively replacing damaged structural elements using deployable modular hardware.
