ETH32 Example Programs

This directory contains a few simple applications and their source code, some 
in several languages, in order to provide a starting point for creating your 
own applications.

NOTE:  In order to run these applications, you must have the Eth32 libraries 
installed on your computer.  Please run the setup/installation program.

The setup/installation program must also have been run to enable you to 
recompile the examples written in a .NET language.  The setup program 
configures the Assembly reference path to allow the compiler to locate 
the Eth32.dll assembly.

To execute any of the examples written in a .NET language, you must have 
the Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or greater installed on your computer.
