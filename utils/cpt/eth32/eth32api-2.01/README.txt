==================================

The source code for the ETH32 API is provided for advanced users who may 
wish to control the ETH32 device from platforms that aren't directly 
supported by Winford Engineering, or who may wish to alter the behavior 
of the API.

Please see the LICENSE.txt file for information regarding how the ETH32
API source code may be used.

Please see the INSTALL.txt file for requirements and instructions for 
compiling and installing the ETH32 API.

Please note that while Winford Engineering fully supports the ETH32 API, 
we do not provide support for the process of compiling the API on your 
system.  If one of the precompiled versions of the API does not meet your 
needs and you are having trouble compiling the API from the source code, 
you may feel free to contact Winford Engineering, but depending on the 
nature and extent of the problem, we may or may not be able to provide 
an answer.
