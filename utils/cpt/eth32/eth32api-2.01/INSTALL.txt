ETH32 API Source Code

==================================
REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION


The ETH32 API has been compiled and tested on Windows and Linux platforms.  
Compiling and using the ETH32 API on other platforms may require some 
modification of the source code.

Windows System Requirements
  * Windows 95 or later
  * MinGW GCC and tools:  http://www.mingw.org
    The following packages should be installed, according to instructions from 
    the MinGW project:
      * gcc-core 3.3.1 or later
      * mingw-runtime
      * mingw-utils
      * w32api
      * binutils
      * make (mingw32-make)
  * WinPcap Developer's Pack (tested with 4.1.1)
      * You must download and extract the WinPcap developer's pack so that the WpdPack directory 
        is underneath the "dependencies" directory of the ETH32 API

Windows Compiling and Installation
   * Install the required packages (listed above) from MinGW.
     Essentially, just unzip (for example with WinZip) each one tar.gz 
     package into the same folder.  There will probably be a few times 
     it prompts you to overwrite an existing file.  It doesn't matter 
     whether you choose to overwrite those files or not.
     We'll assume the packages were unzipped into C:\apps\mingw
   * Extract the ETH32 API source code into a folder if you haven't already.
   * Open a command prompt window
   * Add the MinGW bin directory to your PATH, for example:
     SET PATH=C:\apps\mingw\bin;%PATH%
   * CD into the "win" subdirectory of the ETH32 API source code
   * Compile the API according to the rules within the Makefile by running 
     the command:
      mingw32-make
     Each individual file will be compiled.  At the end, you will get a 
     notice like this, which is fine:
       "dllwrap: no export definition file provided.
        Creating one, but that may not be what you want"
   * If all was compiled successfully, you will be left with (among other files)
     an eth32api.dll file in the "win" directory.
   * The eth32api.dll file should be copied into your system directory
     (for example, C:\Windows\system32).
   * When you compile your applications to use the ETH32 API, you may use the 
     headers and other support files provided with the main ETH32 API distribution, 
     unless you have added, modified, or removed public API functions or their
     arguments.

================================================

Linux System Requirements
  * System with 2.0 kernel or later
  * GCC 2.95.4 or later
  * binutils
  * GNU make
  * Linux pthreads support (included in recent versions of GNU libc)
  * glibc and headers  (tested with glibc 2.3.2)

Linux Compiling and Installation
  * Extract the ETH32 API source code into a directory if you haven't already.
  * cd into the "linux" subdirectory
  * Type "make"
  * If all was compiled successfully, you will be left with (among other files)
    a libeth32.a and libeth32.so.(version) file in the "linux" directory.
  * Run the installation script (type "./install.sh") to install the library 
    and set up the symbolic links
